AutoGraph is a Swift client framework for making requests using GraphQL and mapping the responses to strongly typed models. Models may be represented by any `Decodable` type. AutoGraph relies heavily on Swift's type safety to drive it, leading to safer, compile time checked code.

## Requirements

Swift 5.9

- Swift 5.3.2 iOS 11 - use version `0.15.1`
- Swift 5.2 iOS 10 - use version `0.14.7`
- Swift 5.1.3 iOS 10 - use version `0.11.1`
- Swift 5.0 iOS 8 - use version `0.10.0`
- Swift 5.0 pre Decodable - use version `0.8.0`
- Swift 4.2+ - use version `0.7.0`.
- Swift 4.1.2 - use version `0.5.1`.

### Platforms

- [x] iOS 13.0+
- [ ] tvOS
- [ ] watchOS
- [x] macOS 10.15+
- [ ] Linux

## Installation

### CocoaPods

```
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'AutoGraph'
```

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/remind101/AutoGraph.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.18.0"))
]
```

## Code Generation

AutoGraph offers powerful code generation through [AutoGraphCodeGen](https://github.com/remind101/AutoGraphCodeGen), which transforms GraphQL schemas into native Swift types. This eliminates boilerplate and ensures type safety.

Unlike GraphQL clients that use dictionaries under the hood, AutoGraph generates [zero-cost-abstraction](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/) structs - giving you the convenience of high-level abstractions with the performance of hand-written code.

## Storage and Caching

AutoGraph follows a lightweight, flexible philosophy by intentionally decoupling storage and caching from core functionality. This separation empowers you to:

- Implement exactly the persistence strategy your app requires
- Integrate with your existing storage infrastructure
- Optimize caching based on your specific performance needs
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies and overhead

Simply use AutoGraph to handle GraphQL codegen and networking, then connect the response data to your preferred storage solution‚Äîwhether that's Realm, Core Data, SQLite, or a custom in-memory cache.

While AutoGraph remains focused on its core GraphQL capabilities, we may explore companion libraries for common storage patterns in the future. These would be offered as optional dependencies to maintain AutoGraph's lightweight foundation.

## Query Builder

AutoGraph includes a GraphQL query builder to construct queries in a type safe manner. However, using the query builder is not required; any object which inherits `GraphQLQuery` can act as a query. `String` inherits this by default.

Query Example

```swift
Raw GraphQL         AutoGraph
-----------         ---------
query MyCoolQuery {         AutoGraphQL.Operation(type: .query, name: "MyCoolQuery", fields: [
  user {                        Object(name: "user", fields: [
    favorite_authors {              Object(name: "favorite_authors", fields: [,
      uuid                              "uuid",
      name                              "name"
    }                               ]),
    uuid                            "uuid",
    signature                       "signature"
  }                             ])
}
```

Mutation Example

```swift
Raw GraphQL
-----------
mutation MyCoolMutation {
  updateFavoriteAuthor(uuid: "long_id", input: { name: "My Cool Name" })
  {
    favorite_author {
      uuid
      name
    }
  }
}

AutoGraph
---------
AutoGraphQL.Operation(type: .mutation, name: "MyCoolMutation", fields: [
                            Object(
                            name: "updateFavoriteAuthor",
                            arguments: [ // Continues "updateFavoriteAuthor".
                                "uuid" : "long_id",
                                "input" : [
                                   "name" : "My Cool Class"
                                ]
                            ],
                            fields: [
                                Object(
                                name: "favorite_author",
                                fields: [
                                    "uuid",
                                    "name"
                                    ])
                                ]
                        ])
```

## Subscriptions

AutoGraph now supports subscriptions using the `graphql-ws` protocol. This is this same protocol that Apollo GraphQL server uses, meaning subscriptions will work with Apollo server.

```
let url = URL(string: "wss.mygraphql.com/subscriptions")!
let webSocketClient = try WebSocketClient(url: url)
webSocketClient.delegate = self   // Allows the user to inspect errors and events as they arrive.

let client = try AlamofireClient(url: AutoGraph.localHost,
                                 session: Session(configuration: MockURLProtocol.sessionConfiguration(),
                                                  interceptor: AuthHandler()))
let autoGraph = AutoGraph(client: client, webSocketClient: webSocketClient)

let request = FilmSubscriptionRequest()
let subscriber = self.subject.subscribe(request) { (result) in
    switch result {
    case .success(let object): // Handle new object.
    case .failure(let error):  // Handle error
    }
}

// Sometime later...
try autoGraph.unsubscribe(subscriber: subscriber!)
```

## Decodable for type safe Models

AutoGraph relies entirely on [Decodable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) for mapping GraphQL JSON responses to data models. It's as easy as conforming the model to `Decodable`!

## JSONValue for type safe JSON

Behind the scenes AutoGraph uses [JSONValue](https://github.com/rexmas/JSONValue.git) for type safe JSON. Feel free to import it for your own needs.

## Threading

AutoGraph performs all network requests and mapping off of the main thread. Since a `Request` will eventually return whole models back to the caller on the main thread, it's important to consider thread safety with the model types being used. For this reason, using immutable `struct` types as models is recommended.

## Network Library

AutoGraph currently relies on [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking. However this isn't a hard requirement. Pull requests for this are encouraged!

## Usage:

### Request Protocol

1. Create a class that conforms to the Request protocol. You can also extend an existing class to conform to this protocol. Request is a base protocol used for GraphQL requests sent through AutoGraph. It provides the following parameters.
   1. `queryDocument` - The query being sent. You may use the Query Builder or a String.
   2. `variables` - The variables to be sent with the query. A `Dictionary` is accepted.
   3. `rootKeyPath` - Defines where to start mapping data from. Empty string (`""`) will map from the root of the JSON.
   4. An `associatedtype SerializedObject: Decodable` must be provided to tell AutoGraph what data model to decode to.
   5. A number of methods to inform the Request of its point in the life cycle.

```swift
class FilmRequest: Request {
    /*
     query film {
        film(id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==") {
            id
            title
            episodeID
            director
            openingCrawl
        }
     }
     */

    let query = Operation(type: .query,
                          name: "film",
                          fields: [
                            Object(name: "film",
                                   alias: nil,
                                   arguments: ["id" : "ZmlsbXM6MQ=="],
                                   fields: [
                                    "id",  // May use string literal or Scalar.
                                    Scalar(name: "title", alias: nil),
                                    Scalar(name: "episodeID", alias: nil),
                                    Scalar(name: "director", alias: nil),
                                    Scalar(name: "openingCrawl", alias: nil)])
                            ])

    let variables: [AnyHashable : Any]? = nil

    let rootKeyPath: String = "data.film"

    public func willSend() throws { }
    public func didFinishRequest(response: HTTPURLResponse?, json: JSONValue) throws { }
    public func didFinish(result: Result<Film, Error>) throws { }
}
```

### Sending

#### Swift

1. Call send on AutoGraph
   1. `autoGraph.send(request, completion: { [weak self] result in ... }`
2. Handle the response
   1. result is a generic `Result<SerializedObject, Error>` enum with success and failure cases.

#### Objective-C

Sending via Objective-C isn't directly possible because of AutoGraph's use of `associatedtype` and generics. It is possible to build a bridge(s) from Swift into Objective-C to send requests.
